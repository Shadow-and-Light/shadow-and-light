[color="red"][b]Please Note:[/b][/color] This addon will not function without ElvUI installed.  You can download it at [url=http://www.tukui.org/dl.php]http://www.tukui.org[/url].

Shadow & Light is an external edit of ElvUI, which means it doesn't change ElvUI's files directly.
What does this mean to you?
It means that any time ElvUI gets updated, you will not have to worry about it overwriting our edited version of ElvUI.  It also means if we push an update it will not mess with any ElvUI files.  This addon can not be used without ElvUI installed and enabled.

Originally this project started as two personal edits of ElvUI by Darth Predator and I (Repooc).  For technical support reasons and other reasons as well, we have moved to a combined effort on this external edit of the ElvUI.  Shadow & Light does not disable or hinder the normal function of ElvUI but does add additional features that are not yet implemented or will not be added to ElvUI.
You'll find Shadow & Light options under it's own configuration category in ElvUI's config section by typing /ec

As of 5.2, we have included Affinitii's UI in our install process to make installing his UI a lot easier and more streamlined for people.  One thing that you will need to do manually is install his weak aura profiles as we have not included that will the install as they may change a lot through out the expansion.
If you have questions on how to import these into weak auras, you may contact us through the ticket system or try asking in his stream located at his [url=http://twitch.tv/affinitiibl/]Twitch TV[/url] account.

If you have any questions or concerns, we want to hear about it.  You are welcome to post it via the [url=http://git.tukui.org/repooc/elvui-shadowandlight/issues]Ticket System[/url]. 

Darth Predator and I will do our best to address everyone's concern.  We typically need some information from you other than the problem you are having.  Before posting, PLEASE, make sure you are running the latest version of Shadow & Light as well as ElvUI and that you <b>DISABLE ALL</b> addons except for those two and try to reproduce the issue.  It is important that you do that so we can narrow down what is causing the problem in the first place.

Information to provide when posting:
1.) Shadow & Light Version
2.) ElvUI Version
3.) Provide lua errors
4.) Provide a screenshot if possible
5.) Detailed description of the issue on when it happens, how it happens, whatever you did to reproduce it.
6.) Just to be clear, Disable ALL Addons except for ElvUI and Shadow & Light
With that said, happy gaming and enjoy the addon!
