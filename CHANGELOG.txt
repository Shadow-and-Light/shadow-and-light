v3.57 [September 6th, 2019]
Requires ElvUI 11.22.
Additions:
- Apparently Darth forgot Eternal Palace exists. Now its progress is tracked in tooltips and LFR lockouts are present in time dt.
Changes:
- Removed Bags and Actionbars transparent buttons options. ElvUI deals with those now.
- Removed portrait options for unitframes. ElvUI core function now.
Fixes:
- Fixed clean or first time install errors for locales, this compliments changes in ElvUI.
- Fixed movable frames causing a pletera of errors for "restricted" frames.
- FIxed (probably) datatext panel errors poping up from time to time.
- S&L Friends datatext now can tell apart retail and classic

v3.564 [August 17, 2019]
Changes:
- Changed format of textures used. It is recommended to manually delete S&L folder and install again to avoid duplicate textures with the same format.
Fixes:
- Fixed chat tab width being weird.
- Fixed datatext panels throwing errors in some cases when importing settings.
- Fixed some non-global strings to defy the global locale selection.
- Probably fixed instance indicator not recognizing guild groups.

v3.563 [July 17, 2019]
Additions:
- Added new role icons
- Added prismatic manapearl to currency dt
Fixes:
- Armory now reliably detects essences, not showing damn empty gems. They are now full gems!

v3.562 [July 3, 2019]
Fixes:
- Fixed Darth's noob mistake resulting in portrait alpha not giving a damn about the settings
- Fixed 2 threat position options showing up out of the blue

v3.561 [July 1, 2019]
Additions:
- Added new engineer wormholes to teleport menu
- Added new ore and herb to the list of items deconstruct mode can deal with

v3.56 [June 25, 2019]
Additions:
- Added more hearthstone type items to the portal menu
- Added offset options for target and threat indicators on nameplates
Changes:
- Accounted for changes in ElvUI
- Higher overlay portrait option was removed. Core ElvUI now

v3.551 [June 6th, 2019]
Fixes:
- Fixed tooltip issues with deconstruct button. It should now hide correctly.

v3.55 [May 31st, 2019]
Changes:
- ToggleConfig and ToggleConfigMode was renamed, this fixes the calls to those functions

v3.54 [May 16th, 2019]
Fixes:
- Fixed coloring for quest log underlines
- Fixed wrong raid progress tooltipp
Changes:
- Sort of support for changes in ElvUI 11.11

v3.53 [April 7th, 2019]
Fixes:
- Fixed applying layout reseting nameplates again
- Fixed M+ banner not disappearing when corresponding option is enabled. Statusbar skin and affix style comming at later date.
- Fixed minimap button bar breaking when changing directions
- Fixed Outfitter checkboxes not visible
- Fixed Armory stat scroll not being large enough
- Fixed vehicle bar not thinking crabs are vehicles
- Fixed tooltip appearing for a split-second on raid markers when tooltips are turned off for those
- Fixed war campaing auto order
- Fixed some profile swap errors

Known issues:
Armory items breaking is still under investigation.

v3.521 [March 13th, 2019]
Fixes:
- Fixed install layout profile not having correct raid frame visibility. It should be [nogroup] hide; show
Changes:
- Moving chat datapanels down is still off by default. I'll just reiterate this one again. I want default looks of s&l be as close to original ElvUI as possible. Armory being obvious exception.
Option to enbale that back is under /ec - S&L - Modules - Datatext - Override Chat DT Panels
- Added WardrobeFrame to the list of stuff you can move around

v3.52 [March 12th, 2019]
Version for patch 8.1.5 and ElvUI v11. Please do not update to this version if it is tuesday and you play on EU.
Additions:
- Totally forgot raids exist. Added LFR tracking options for Dazar'Alor and Crucible of Storms. Also added those to raid progression (which also should be working again)
Changes:
- Vehicle seat option removed. ElvUI's core option is enough.
- New ElvUI nameplates support (probably shouldn't blow up)
- Viewport (if you know where it is) is now following new scaling system in ElvUI. Max/min values are still the same. If those somehow will happen to not be enough, let me know.
- New install layout. Keep in mind that those are settings I play with, thus assuming you'll love it at the first glance is wrong. Also this is a "basic" frame of what I use, not included most class/character specific stuff.
So if you are not sure if you should use it, don't. You'll save both your and my time on weird questions like "what on earth is this chtulhu shaped thing on my nameplate?"
- Moving chat data panels down is now off by default
Fixes:
- Fixed errors for order hall/ war campaign talent frame dropping errors when opened for the first time with movable blizz frames enabled (and set to record positions)
This fix overrules old code to prevent some frames randomly jumping around. They shouldn't behave like crazy, but keep a tranq rifle just in case.
- A check was put in place to prevent unknown force from populating saved positions for frames with some next level crazy stuff, resulting in inability to export private options.
- Fixed an error in location panel when trying to open portal menu with no hearthstone of any description being in the inventory or toybox.
- Fixed copy-paste fail in unitframes options causing portrait settings applying only after ui reload
- Another attempt at finding the root of Armory breaking at random. If this doesn't help, I'll need more test info.

Possible issues:
- I wasn't able to test how S&L's quest log collapce/hide feature works with ElvUI's feature to hide in arenas.
Probably will have issues. Please report if you notice something off.
- Some frames will be auto repositioning other frames on first ever load after latest movable frames changes. After that everything should be fine.

v3.511 [March 3rd, 2019]
Fixes:
- Disabling armory now should correctly allow ElvUI to display gear ilvl and enchants (I blame Simpy)
- Fixed stats and stat scrollbar being broken (Still blaming Simpy)

v3.51 [February 24th, 2019]
Requires ElvUI 10.88 to work properly
Misc:
- Adjustments needed to work with ElvUI 10.88 error free (hopefully)

v3.5 [January 22nd, 2019]
Additions:
- Armory and afk screen now support Wakanda trolls and humans living on ships
- Character armory option to color ilvl text based on quality now allows you to select another variant - based on items ilvl compared to average equipped ilvl. Same or higher ilvl will be green, all below will become more red the bigger the difference is.
This one will probably be not accurate for low level toons due to math used here is some afroengineering™ and based on max level toons ilvl numbers.
Fixes:
- Rep text now properly shows reputation gains toward that sweet (not) paragon chest
- Fixed icons on datatetxs not following mouseover on load or changing datatexts
- DBM icon for skinned minimap button is now correct
Misc:
- Some profile db conversion was added to account for ilvl text coloring option. Last one with hearthstone priority went withoput problems, but who knows. Just keep an eye on it.
- More attempts to fix seemingly random issue with character armory breaking on equipping new gear. If it breaks again, I'll need as much info of what happened for about a minute period before everything went to hell.

v3.492 [December 19, 2018]
Fixes:
- Localtion panel coordinates link is now working again
Changes:
- Event description frame in calendar is now not movable to avoid positioning issues.

v3.481 [November 21st 2018]

- Attempt to avoid another case of item info absence causing graphical glitches in character armory
- Fixed pvp level text not showing up
- Fixed AzeriteTooltip compatibility with armory
- Probably fixed double transmog lines on inspected gear
Changes:
- Tab handling functions were rewritten. Now with any sizing option selected they should properly do "overflow" behavior and show select dropdown buttons for tabs not on screen.
- LFR info on in time datatext will only show active wings info. Blizz functions for getting LFR data are in even more broken than before so they return wrong info about wings and raids you can't get into by using LFG tool.
- Attempting to deal with weird sorting errors in toolbars. Not sure if that will help.
- Removed 3 currencies used by warfronts only from currency datatext.
- Removed an option to reposition incoming healing bars.
- Removed tooltip offset options for tooltip showing up at cursor position. This is in default ElvUI now.
- Changed inspect logic to fallback to default item info if you lost target with inspect window opened. That will result in items not showing transmog and azerite traits.
Misc:
- Attempt to request instanse info less often for minimap indicator
- Backend change to afk screen working logic.
